# What is Rock_Paper_Scissors-Game?
Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). The rules are straightforward:

   * Rock smashes scissors.
   * Paper covers rock.
   * Scissors cut paper.
   
# Rock_Paper_Scissors-Game using Python-
To create and play rock paper scissors, I will be using the if and elif statements in Python. I will prepare this game to be played between two players. Player-1 will be the user, and player-2 will be the computer. Player one will manually select the rock paper or scissor, while player two will choose randomly. So I will also use the random module in Python to create this game.
